<h1>Weather Dashboard</h1>
<h3>Project Details</h3>
<p>This was developed to show a user the current weather and 5 day forecast when searching for a city. When the search button is presented with a city, and clicked, it will give the current weather information for that day. It will also show the following 5 day weather forecast. This is meant to help travelers plan out there schedule accordingly</p>
<h3>Working Details</h3>
<p>I used moment.js to get the time and date, and openweather to get the weather information on this page. I used jQuery to write the code, and dynamically add elements to the page. The buttons on the side are some example cities that, if selected, will show the current weather for that day. Local storage is used to keep track of previous searches, added function that renders previous searches as options when you click on search box.</p>
